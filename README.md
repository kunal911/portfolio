## Projects

### Electric Vehicle Data Analysis
- [Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kunal.manjare/viz/ElectricVehicleDataAnalysis_17191734201230/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
- Created a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau to analyze electric vehicle data, including metrics on vehicle usage, Average Electric Vehicle Range, and performance trends.
- Leveraged Tableau's advanced data visualization capabilities to provide actionable insights and support decision-making processes related to electric vehicle infrastructure and adoption.

### Hurricane Visualization - Development of Interactive 3D Hurricane Visualization
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kunal911/CS-6635-5635-Final-Project)
- Employed Python to streamline meteorological data by converting diverse formats into a unified, accessible structure for visualization.
 Additionally, crafted scripts to effectively minimize noise within the data.
- Innovatively implemented Python techniques to generate interactive 3D visualizations of hurricanes, incorporating key parameters such as windspeed, pressure, and precipitation. Pioneered a novel visualization technique to accentuate the hurricane’s eye and its surrounding eyewall for enhanced clarity.

### Sports Visualization - Web Application providing insights about the Indian Premier League (IPL)
- [GitHub Page](https://kunal911.github.io/Data-Visualization-Final-Project-/)
-  Developed a web‑application to display rankings, player performance and represent ball‑by‑ball visualization using D3 framework of JavaScript. Preprocessed the data to parse multiple JSON files to extract and combine information to create my own objects.
- Two formats of data are used, combined information from JSON for the ball‑by‑ball visualization while the information from CSV is used for the ranking history of the teams.

### Voraus AgriBot - An Autonomous Image Processing based Agricultural Robot
- Designed an algorithm to classify raw and ripened tomatoes by using Region‑based Convolutional Neural Network (R‑CNN) and DarkNet‑53,thereby achieving classification accuracy of 90% and 94.67% respectively.
-  Created a coordinate measurement system that generated 3D coordinates of the tomatoes in real‑time using Python‑ OpenCV. Constructed a functional robotic arm integrated with a three‑jaw gripper to precisely cut a ripened tomato.

## Leadership and Accomplishments
- Served as the Secretary of the Electronics Engineering Student Association (EESA) from 2017 to 2018, contributing to the growth and development of the organization.
