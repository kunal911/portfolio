### Projects
_Hurricane Visualization ‑ Development of Interactive 3D Hurricane Visualization using
 Python and Paraview_ [(https://github.com/kunal911/CS-6635-5635-Final-Project)]
 Visualization for Scientific Data(CS 6635)                                             Jan 2023‑ April 2023
 • Employed Python to streamline meteorological data by converting diverse formats into a unified, accessible structure for visualization.
 Additionally, crafted scripts to effectively minimize noise within the data.
 • Innovatively implemented Python techniques to generate interactive 3D visualizations of hurricanes, incorporating key parameters such as windspeed, pressure, and precipitation. Pioneered a novel visualization technique to accentuate the hurricane’s eye and its surrounding eyewall for enhanced clarity.

_Sports Visualization‑ Web Application providing insights about the Indian Premier
 League(IPL)_ [(https://kunal911.github.io/Data-Visualization-Final-Project-/)]
 Visualization for Data Science(CS 6630)                                                 Aug 2022 ‑ Dec 2022
